	<p>I am a first year graduate student with experience in nucleic acids chemistry, specifically L-RNA aptamers and mirror-image selections. My experience with the field has been in doing a reverse selection on a mutated library with an already accepted aptamer. Pictured is a generalized process for this type of selection. </p>

	<h1> Why is this relevant? </h1>
	<img src= "img2.png" />

	<p> Mirror-image selections allow for the selective evoution of biomolecule specific L-DNA and L-RNA aptamers from large starting libraries, while still using native enzymes for transcription and amplification. These L-nucleic acids do not get degraded by native nucleases, so they show promise for in-vivo applications. Pictured is a process for affixing an aptamer to a magnetic, streptavidin-coated bead for easy separation of bound targets. I used this motif to determine the promiscuity of an L-RNA HIV TAR aptamer by selecting against libraries of TAR hairpins with discrete mutated regions. </p>
